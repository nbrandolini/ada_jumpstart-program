Loops Worksheet
Read the code in each section, then write exactly what the code prints out. Use a loop table to help you track each variable for each iteration.

Each problem stands alone. Variables from previous problems do not exist.

Example:

x = 5
y = 6
print(x+y) #=> 11

end
Answer: 1 animal(s)
        2 animal(s)

total = 0
(1..3).each do |i|
  total = total + i
end
puts total
Answer: 6
(for i = 1, total is 0; for i = 2, total become 1, and for i = 3, total become 3) the outcome asks for total which is total + i so the outcome becomes 3 + 3 = 6


(1..10).each do |x|
  if x == 5
    puts "You got a winner!"
  end
end
Answer: You got a winner! for x == 5

end
Answer: hi
        hi
        hi

i = 0

while i < 3
  puts "hi"
  i = i + 1
end

puts "bye"
Answer: hi
        hi

x = 5
i = 0

while i < 3
  x = x + 1
