Conditional practice

Use your new knowledge of conditionals to recreate this flow control diagram using conditionals in code.
Assume that the x and y variable data comes from user input prior to the conditional execution.
flow control assignment

puts "Please enter x:"
x= gets.chomp
puts "Please enter y:"
y = gets.chomp

if x == y
  print "equal"
  elsif x > y 
  print "greater"
  elsif x < y 
  print "less"
  
end

Now we will go the other way! Using the code below create the flow control diagram that would represent it.

number_of_sides = gets.chomp

if number_of_sides == 1
  print "You've got a line"
elsif number_of_sides == 2
  print "I'm not really sure what you have"
elsif number_of_sides == 3
  print "You've got a triangle"
elsif number_of_sides == 4
  print "You've got some sort of quadrilateral"
end
Read the code in each section, draw a corresponding flow chart and then predict the output. Check your answers by running the code snippets in Terminal.

# problem 1
cookies = true
cake = false

if cookies == true
   print "OMG COOKIEZ"
end
Answer: OMG COOKIEZ

if cake == true
   print "OMG CAKE!"
else
   print "WHATEVZ DESSERTZ."
end
Answer: WHATEVZ DESSERTZ

# problem 2
person_age = 55
ada_age = 2

if person_age < ada_age
   print "This person is younger"
elsif ada_age < person_age
   print "Ada is younger"
else
   print "Theyâ€™re the same!"
end
Answer: Ada is younger

# problem 3
pet = "cat"
food = "ice cream"

if pet == "cat"
   print "here kitty"
elsif pet == "dog"
   print "woof"
else
   print "some other sound"
end
Answer: here kitty

if food == "broccoli"
   print "eh."
elsif food == "ice cream"
   print "yum"
end
Answer: yum

# problem 4
x = 7
y = 7

if x >= y
   if x > y
      print "x is bigger"
   else
      print "x = y"
   end
else
   print "y is bigger"
end
Answer: x = y

# problem 5
x = 7
y = 7

if x > y || x == y
   if x > y
      print "x is bigger"
   else
      print "x = y"
   end
else
   print "y is bigger"
end
Answer: x = y

# problem 6
x = 7
y = 7

if x >= y
   print "x is bigger"
else
   print "y is bigger"
end
Answer: x is bigger

if x == y
   print "x = y"
end
Answer: x = y
